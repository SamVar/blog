This week I am going to setup a home VPN so I can access my home network from anywhere the world. I will go step by step on how to setup and configure VPN so it works correctly.

**Requirements**

- Raspberry Pi 4
- Pi VPN

I bought Raspberry Pi from [Amazon](https://www.amazon.com/CanaKit-Raspberry-4GB-Starter-Kit/dp/B07V5JTMV9/ref=sxin_9_ac_d_pm?ac_md=4-1-QmV0d2VlbiAkNzUgYW5kICQxMDA%3D-ac_d_pm&crid=2GGGMAKI2VAF6&cv_ct_cx=raspberry+pi+4&dchild=1&keywords=raspberry+pi+4&pd_rd_i=B07V5JTMV9&pd_rd_r=15abbd55-01d7-46b1-9058-2ee86efebbe8&pd_rd_w=oh0r8&pd_rd_wg=DPetM&pf_rd_p=7bce1efb-5229-4289-8758-b64b1d02cfb8&pf_rd_r=YYF8FVX1CYY5D7CVM5D8&psc=1&qid=1601606153&sprefix=ras%2Caps%2C235&sr=1-2-22d05c05-1231-4126-b7c4-3e7a9c0027d0), this is CanaKit starter Kit 4GB of ram. It comes with case, fan, heatsink, micro SD card, cables, power adapter. It is full kit to assemble and start your Raspberry Pi. The kit comes disassembled, so we need to assemble it. It is very easy task to to. It took me only 5 minutes. First we apply heatsinks onto cpu then gpu and usb controller. After installing the heatsinks we install the fan and put the board inside of the case.

**Installing RaspberryOS**

Next thing we need to do is to download and install [RaspberryOS](https://www.raspberrypi.org/downloads/) on micros SD card. Once it is installed on SD card we can put SD card into Raspberry Pi and boot from SD card. After the first boot we need to update our system to make sure we have latest updates on our system, to do so open the terminal and type:
{% highlight ruby %}
sudo apt-get update && sudo apt-get upgrade -y
{% endhighlight %}

\
**Installing PiVPN (WireGuard)**

The next step is to install [PiVPN](https://www.pivpn.io/), open Terminal on your Raspberry Pi and run the command below, which will execute a script to install PiVPN (which has WireGuard built-in).

{% highlight ruby %}
curl -L https://install.pivpn.io | bash
{% endhighlight %}

\
\
Wait for the process to install the necessary packages. When it’s done, you will be brought to a screen that will inform you that PiVPN will allow you to install OpenVPN or WireGuard on a Raspberry Pi. Select OK.

\
\
The next screen will inform you that you need to set a static IP address. It’s best to set a static IP address in your router’s settings, as you are ensuring that DHCP does not try and give this address to any other devices. However, certain routers (mostly ISP provided ones) do not allow you to complete DHCP reservations. If you can’t set a static IP address for your Raspberry Pi in your router, set a static IP address on the Raspberry Pi by following the instructions. I specified a static IP address in my router so I am going to skip this step.

\
\
You will now need to select a local user. If you’ve created a different user (outside of the default pi user), you will have the option here then you will be asked to select a VPN type. Select WireGuard.

\
\
WireGuard will now install, then you will be asked to enter the port you’d like to use (default is 51820). It’s probably best to keep it as the default, but if you have a reason to change it, you can do that here. NOTE: This is UDP port 51820.

\
\
You now need to select the DNS provider you’d like to use. Select Custom if you’d like to use your own DNS server, or any of the public DNS providers if you don’t want to use a local DNS server.

![image](/blog/assets/images/dns.jpeg)

\
\
You will now be prompted to use your public IP address or public DNS entry. If you have a static IP address, you are free to use this address. However, if you have a dynamic external IP address, you will need to set up DDNS. If you selected to use a dynamic DNS address, you can enter that information here.

\
\
At the next screen, select Yes to confirm that it is correct. You will now be prompted that the server keys will be generated. Select OK. The next step will tell you that the VPN Server will check for unattended-upgrades, and a periodic reboot will be required. This is a great option. Enable unattended-upgrades (unless you have a good reason not to) and proceed. The packages will now install.

\
\
And that is it, the installation is now complete! Reboot your system.

\
**Configuration File Changes**

The two changes that we will make below are in the wg0 config file. Run these commands to open the config file:

{% highlight ruby %}
sudo su
nano /etc/wireguard/wg0.conf
{% endhighlight %}

\
This section is a little tricky because these lines will be mandatory if you’re interested in using a split-tunnel VPN profile. If you are using full-tunnel only, there’s a chance that everything will work without adding the PostUp and PostDown lines to the config file. So in summary, add these lines if you intend on using a split-tunnel VPN profile. If you only intend on using full-tunnel, you might not need to add these lines as all traffic will be routed through your Raspberry Pi.

**PostUp:** command that is executed when you connect to your WireGuard VPN.

- **IPTables:** What the system should do with certain packets. A table is created with these rules so the system knows what to do when it receives a packet. These are what the different command-line parameters mean.
- **Masquerade:** IP address will be rewritten from source (wg0) to destination (eth0). In layman’s terms, the traffic appears as if it originates from the Raspberry Pi as opposed to the source device. When traffic comes in and is sent to your client device (where you are connected to the VPN), the traffic will have the destination IP rewritten from eth0 (Raspberry Pi) to wg0 (WireGuard network). You still need a static route if you’d like to access your VPN clients!

**PostDown:** command that is executed when you disconnect from your WireGuard VPN to undo everything that we did in the “PostUp” command.
Add these lines to the config file to create an IP table when you connect to WireGuard and masquerade your IP address.

{% highlight ruby %}
PostUp = iptables -A FORWARD -i wg0 -j ACCEPT; iptables -A FORWARD -o wg0 -j ACCEPT; iptables -t nat -A POSTROUTING -o eth0 -j MASQUERADE
PostDown = iptables -D FORWARD -i wg0 -j ACCEPT; iptables -D FORWARD -o wg0 -j ACCEPT; iptables -t nat -D POSTROUTING -o eth0 -j MASQUERADE
{% endhighlight %}

Save the file and exit!

\
**VPN Profile Creation - WireGuard Raspberry Pi**

\
Run the command below to add a profile.
{% highlight ruby %}
sudo pivpn add
{% endhighlight %}

![image](/blog/assets/images/vpn-config.jpeg)

We are adding 2 VPN profiles one for split tunnel and second for full tunnel. Just add client name and hit `Enter`
Navigate to the configs folder. There will be two config files, one for our split-tunnel profile and one for our full-tunnel.
{% highlight ruby %}
cd configs
{% endhighlight %}

\
By default, WireGuard is configured as full-tunnel. For this reason, we can leave the full-tunnel file alone and edit the split-tunnel file. The only change that we have to make here is the AllowedIPs line. By default, AllowedIPs is set as 0.0.0.0/0 which means that all traffic will go through your home network (full-tunnel VPN). To change this so that only local traffic is sent through WireGuard, we need to change this line to our local IP range. For most people, it will be 192.168.1.0/24 or 192.168.0.0/24. If you aren’t sure what your IP range is, you can look in your router’s configuration under LAN Setup.

\
WireGuard attempts to be as quiet as possible, meaning that it only sends and receives packets when it needs to. For this reason, clients behind a NAT or firewall might be required to keep the connection alive even when it’s not in use. To do this, you need to make a change in the configuration file.

Run these commands to open the configuration file.

{% highlight ruby %}
sudo su
nano /etc/wireguard/wg0.conf
{% endhighlight %}

You will see the VPN profiles that you configured. Add the line below to the profiles where you would like the connection to stay active.

{% highlight ruby %}
PersistentKeepalive=25
{% endhighlight %}

\
**Port Forwarding**

We now need to port forward UDP port 51820 on our router to our Raspberry Pi. Create a port forwarding rule for UDP port 51820 to your Raspberry Pi’s IP address. In the example below, 192.168.1.30 is the IP address of my Raspberry Pi.

\
**Connecting to VPN Server**

For both, smartphones and computers we need to install `Wireguard` application.
Then you can generate a QR code for your device which will import VPN profile and its configurations. Run the following command to create a QR code:

{% highlight ruby %}
pivpn -qr [PROFILE_NAME]
{% endhighlight %}

Once the configuration is imported into `Wireguard` application just toggle the ON switch to connect to your VPN server.

\
**Conclusion**

The setup process for WireGuard on a Raspberry Pi is very simple but super powerful. If you have an old Raspberry Pi laying around or you’re comfortable buying an additional device, this is a great way to use an awesome VPN product with amazing performance.
