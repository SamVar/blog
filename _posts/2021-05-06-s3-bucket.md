**Introduction**

This week I am going to talk about AWS S3 bucket. Amazon S3 Stands for Amazon Simple Storage Service, which provides Object-Based Storage for uploading or downloading your flat files(Images, Videos, Documents, etc) using a secure web service Interface.

\
**How to Create S3 Bucket**

Login to your AWS account and navigate to `Services` then `S3` and click on **Create Bucket**. Enter the name of Bucket that you want to Create and Click on Next.Make sure you enter a Unique Bucket name as S3 bucket name is globally unique otherwise you may get error stating ” Bucket name already exists”

\
AWS S3 Make Public Access denied by default. This means no body can access you S3 Bucket over the internet until you allow public access. By unchecking `Block all public access` or we can provide IAM user Credentials. We are going to block all public access and clikck Next. Review the settings in this page and Click on `Create Bucket`.

\
**Access S3 Bucket**

\
To access our S3 bucket we need to SSH to the EC2 Instance from where we want to access S3 Bucket and install AWSCLI or Install at our Local System.

{% highlight ruby %}
$ sudo apt-get install awscli -y
{% endhighlight %}

Then we need to configure our awscli by typing `aws configure` after it is configured we type `aws s3 ls` and from here we can upload and download files from and to our S3 bucket.
