**Introduction**

This week I am going to talk about how I made my own website and hosted it. I am very much into astronomy and astrophotography and I decided to make a website that calculates moon phase and moon disk illumination for a given date. I could've used an API to do all the work for me, but I decided I want to create my own algorithm to calculate moon phase for a given day and year. 

**Requirements**

- Code editor (I use VS Code)
- Knowledge of HTML CSS JavaScript Bootstrap JQuerry
- Video and Photo editing software

**Technologies used**

- HTML
- CSS
- JavaScript
- JQuery
- Bootstrap
- Lightbox

**Moon Project**

So this project took me  over 6 month cause it was a big project at least for me. I started writing the website structure with HTML and then added CSS to make the site pretty. I also used Bootstrap to make the site more responsive even though some of the pages of this site I had to make responsive manually meaning with no help of the Bootstrap. The hardest part was to write the logic in javascript that was going to calculate the moon phase for a given day. I spent well over 2 month just on research, finally after 2 months I was ready to write the logic. I ended up having 6 html files 2 css files, 8 javaScript files and bunch of pictures and photos over 100 photos. I also integrated Lightbox into my project to make viewing images easier for the user. Total was 450 MB of code. After finishing the website I needed to make it responsive for all different kind of devices. This part took me really long time since there are so many devices out there such as mobile devices, computers tablets etc. I ended up having a website that not just calculates moon phase and illumination for a given date but also has some interesting information about our solar system, planets, nebulae, galaxies, deep sky objects etc. The website is live at [Moonguide.net](https://moonguide.net/index.html) address. It also available in my Github repository called [webdev](https://github.com/SamVar/webdev). In my next post I will explain how I hosted my website and how I forwarded it to my domain name.
