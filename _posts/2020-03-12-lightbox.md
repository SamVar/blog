**What is Lightbox**

A Lightbox is a window overlay that appears over a webpage, blocking some of the content and dimming and disabling the rest of the background. This ensures a site visitor cannot interact with other content on the website until they take action â€” either by clicking a button, filling out the popup, or exiting out of it. Though it can appear anywhere on the screen, a Lightbox most often appears in the center. Lightbox popups are effective for a few reasons, they remove all other distractions on a page and clearly tell visitors what they should do next. Plus, you can click anywhere outside of the popup to close them. Lightbox popups can be used for a variety of purposes. Today I am going to talk about Lightbox for website images. When user clicks on the image it opens in the Lightbox and user have the ability to go to next or previous image or close the Lightbox.

It can show the image number if you are using images set and the image name, it has next and previous buttons to change the picture and also you can close the Lightbox. When it is active everything on the webpage is deactivate.

**Where to find the Lightbox**

Lightbox is an open source project that you can download and integrate into your website. It is written by a developer called Lokesh Dhakar. It is available on the [Gitgub](https://github.com/lokesh/lightbox2) as well as on [Lightbox](https://lokeshdhakar.com/projects/lightbox2/) website. So how do we get it? We go to [Lightbox Github Page](https://github.com/lokesh/lightbox2) and download the zip file. Once downloaded we unzip it and now we have a folder called Lightbox with bunch of files in it. Once we have the folder and the files the next step would be to integrate into our project.

**How to Integrate**

Now when we have the folder we need to include Lightbox CSS and JavaScript into our project. First we copy the folder Lightbox into our project folder. Then we include Lightbox CSS and JavaScript.

- Include CSS:
{% highlight ruby %}
<link href="path/to/lightbox.css" rel="stylesheet" />
{% endhighlight %}
- Include JavaScript:
  {% highlight ruby %}
  <script src="path/to/lightbox.js"></script>
  {% endhighlight %}

If you already use jQuery on your page, make sure it is loaded before lightbox.js. jQuery 1.7 or greater is required. Now we can use it in our html file.

- Single images. Add a `data-lightbox` attribute to any image link to enable Lightbox. For the value of the attribute, use a unique name for each image. For example:
  {% highlight ruby %}
  <a href="images/image-1.jpg" data-lightbox="image-1" data-title="My caption">Image #1</a>
  {% endhighlight %}
  Add a `data-title` attribute if you want to show a caption.
  Add a `data-alt` attribute if you want to set the alt attribute of the linked image.

- Image sets. If you have a group of related images that you would like to combine into a set, use the same `data-lightbox` attribute value for all of the images. For example:
  {% highlight ruby %}
  <a href="images/image-2.jpg" data-lightbox="roadtrip">Image #2</a>
  <a href="images/image-3.jpg" data-lightbox="roadtrip">Image #3</a>
  <a href="images/image-4.jpg" data-lightbox="roadtrip">Image #4</a>
  {% endhighlight %}

And that's all to it. Now we have fully functional Lightbox for our images and we can add as many images as we want.
