**Introduction**

This week we are going to create a function that uses API and shows COVID cases worldwide. I am going to do this, because I need it for my senior project since our team has been working on a website that gives COVID-19 cases worldwide and uses COVID-19 API to fetch worldwide information about COVID. In order to fetch the data from API we need to find API that provides all the information that we need. So, I decided to go for website called [Rapid API](https://rapidapi.com/marketplace) they have a lot of different APIs, but the one we are interested in is called **Coronavirus Monitor**. In order to use this API we need to subscribe and choose a monthly plan for our Rapid API account.

\
**Implementation**

Once we sign up and choose our plan with Rapid API, we can choose which API we are interested in. After choosing the API, it is good idea to read the documentation of the API. In my case I already did so I will proceed to the next step and choose which format I want to receive data in my API. I will go with **JSON** format since it is easier for me. They provide you with the templet code that you can copy and paste into your project. It looks something like this:

{% highlight ruby %}
fetch("https://coronavirus-monitor.p.rapidapi.com/coronavirus/random_masks_usage_instructions.php", {
	"method": "GET",
	"headers": {
		"x-rapidapi-key": "My_Rapid_API_Key",
		"x-rapidapi-host": "coronavirus-monitor.p.rapidapi.com"
	}
})
.then(response => {
	console.log(response);
})
.catch(err => {
	console.error(err);
});
{% endhighlight %}

\
\
In the first line you fetch data from API using **fetch** command and providing the source in this case link to their website. Then we provide method which is **GET** and on the next line we provide our API key. So now we need to change the code a little bit so it works on our website. First of all we need to have **HTML** file that will show all the information of the API. I am not going to talk about how to make an HTML file and create a card so you can display API information inside of the card. In my case I already have 3 cards created on my HTML page so I can display **Active Cases,** **Deaths** and **Recovered Cases** inside of that cards. All I need to do is have IDs attached to my cards so I can use those IDs to display information into that card. Inside my javascript file I need to read those IDs:


{% highlight ruby %}
let new_cases = document.getElementById("new_case");
let new_death = document.getElementById("new_death");
let total_death = document.getElementById("total_death");
let total_recovered = document.getElementById("total_recovered");
let total_cases = document.getElementById("total_cases");
let table = document.getElementById("countries_stat");
{% endhighlight %}

\
\
We are storing those IDs inside of the variables so we can use them later and display information on the page using those IDs. After that we need to add the second part of our code which was the json template but we modified it so we can read data from API:

{% highlight ruby %}
let new_cases = document.getElementById("new_case");
let new_death = document.getElementById("new_death");
let total_death = document.getElementById("total_death");
let total_recovered = document.getElementById("total_recovered");
let total_cases = document.getElementById("total_cases");
let table = document.getElementById("countries_stat");
fetch("https://coronavirus-monitor.p.rapidapi.com/coronavirus/worldstat.php", {
	method: "GET",
	headers: {
		"x-rapidapi-host": "coronavirus-monitor.p.rapidapi.com",
		"x-rapidapi-key": "My_Rapid_API_Key",
	},
})
	.then((response) =>
		response.json().then((data) => {
			console.log(data);
			total_cases.innerHTML = data.total_cases;
			new_cases.innerHTML = "+" + data.new_cases;
			new_death.innerHTML = "+" + data.new_deaths;
			total_death.innerHTML = data.total_deaths;
			total_recovered.innerHTML = data.total_recovered;
		})
	)
	.catch((err) => {
		console.log(err);
	});
{% endhighlight %}

\
In the first part we stored all the IDs inside of variables. In the second part we are are fetching information from our source using our key. After that we are reading the response that website provides to us and store them inside of our cards using IDs we created earlier. After that all we need to do is to log any errors that we might have into console. This is final rendered page using Coronavirus API:
